## Automatic setup

You may have tried to use our quick start guide to setup your project for Storybook.
If it failed because it couldn't detect you're using [Rax](https://github.com/alibaba/rax), you could try forcing it to use Rax:

```sh
npx -p @storybook/cli sb init --type rax
```

## Manual setup

If you want to set up Storybook manually for your Rax project, this is the guide for you.

## Step 1: Add dependencies

### Add @storybook/rax

Add `@storybook/rax` to your project. To do that, run:

```sh
npm install @storybook/rax --save-dev
```

### Add rax, @babel/core and babel-loader

Make sure that you have `rax`, `@babel/core`, and `babel-loader` in your dependencies as well because we list these as a peer dependencies:

```sh
npm install rax --save
npm install babel-loader @babel/core --save-dev
```

## Step 2: Add npm scripts

Then add the following scripts to your `package.json` in order to start the storybook later in this guide:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "storybook": "start-storybook",
    "build-storybook": "build-storybook"
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Create the main file

For a basic Storybook configuration, the only thing you need to do is tell Storybook where to find stories.

To do that, create a file at `.storybook/main.js` with the following content:

```js
module.exports = {
  stories: ['../src/**/*.stories.[tj]s'],
};
```

That will load all the stories underneath your `../src` directory that match the pattern `*.stories.js`. We recommend co-locating your stories with your source files, but you can place them wherever you choose.

## Step 4: Write your stories

Now create a `../src/index.stories.js` file, and write your first story like this:

```js
import { createElement } from 'rax';
import Button from '<your button>';

export const { title: 'Button' }
export const withText = () => <Button>Hello Button</Button>;
export const withEmoji = () => <Button>üòÄ üòé üëç üíØ</Button>;
```

Each story is a single state of your component. In the above case, there are two stories for the demo button component:

```plaintext
Button
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ With Text
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ With Emoji
```

## Finally: Run your Storybook

Now everything is ready. Run your storybook with:

```sh
npm run storybook
```

Storybook should start, on a random open port in dev-mode.

Now you can develop your components and write stories and see the changes in Storybook immediately since it uses Webpack's hot module reloading.
