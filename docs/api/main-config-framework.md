## `name`

Type: `string`

For available frameworks and their options, see their respective [documentation](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/frameworks).

## `options`

Type: `Record<string, any>`

While many options are specific to a framework, there are some options that are shared across some frameworks, e.g. those that configure Storybook's [builder](./main-config-core.md#builder).

### `options.builder`

Type: `Record<string, any>`

Configures Storybook's builder, [Vite](../builders/vite.md) or [Webpack](../builders/webpack.md).

#### `options.builder.useSWC`

(⚠️ **Experimental**)

For frameworks made with the [Webpack](../builders/webpack.md) builder, this option allows you to use the [SWC](https://swc.rs/) compiler instead of [Babel](../configure/babel.md).

When Storybook loads, it will update Webpack's configuration including the required loaders (e.g., [`TerserPlugin`](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/terser-webpack-plugin/), [`babel-loader`](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/babel-loader/)) with SWC equivalents (e.g., [`swc-loader`](https://swc.rs/docs/usage/swc-loader)) for bundling and minification.
