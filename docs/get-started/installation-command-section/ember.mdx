Use the Storybook CLI to install it with a couple of commands. Run this inside your _existing projectâ€™s_ root directory:

```shell
# Add Storybook:
npx sb init

# Add Ember storybook adapter
ember install @storybook/ember-cli-storybook

```

If you run into issues with the installation, check the [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) below for guidance on how to solve it.
