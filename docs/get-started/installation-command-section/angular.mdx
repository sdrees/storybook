- Use the Storybook CLI to install it in a single command. Run this inside your _existing projectâ€™s_ root directory:

```shell
# Add Storybook:
npx sb init
```

- Update your `angular.json` file to include Storybook's custom builder:

```json
{
  "storybook": {
    "builder": "@storybook/angular:start-storybook",
    "options": {
      "browserTarget": "angular-cli:build",
      "port": 6006
    }
  },
  "build-storybook": {
    "builder": "@storybook/angular:build-storybook",
    "options": {
      "browserTarget": "angular-cli:build"
    }
  }
}
```

If you run into issues with the installation, check the [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) below for guidance on how to solve it.
