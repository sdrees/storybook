Use the Storybook CLI to install it in a single command. Run this inside your existing Vue 2 projectâ€™s root directory:

```shell
# Add Storybook:
npx sb init
```

For Vue 3 projects, run this inside your projectâ€™s root directory:

```shell
# Add Storybook ðŸ”¥ pre-release ðŸ”¥ version:

npx sb@next init
```

This command installs the latest pre-release version of Storybook with a new package (ðŸ“¦ [`@storybook/vue3`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/vue3)), created specifically for Vue 3.

If you run into issues with the installation, check the troubleshooting section below for guidance on how to solve it.
