- Storybook's CLI provides support for both [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package managers.
  If you have Yarn installed in your environment but prefer to use npm as your default package manager add the `--use-npm` flag to your installation command. For example:
  
  ```shell
  npx storybook init --use-npm
  ```

- Add the `--type svelte` flag to the installation command to set up Storybook manually:

  ```shell
  npx sb init --type svelte
  ```

- For issues with Svelte Native Story Format, check the [Svelte Story Format addon repository](https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-svelte-csf) for instructions.
- For other installation issues, check the [Svelte README](../../app/svelte/README.md) for additional instructions.
