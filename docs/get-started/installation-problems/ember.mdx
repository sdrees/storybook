Update the [`@storybook/ember-cli-storybook`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/ember-cli-storybook) package to the latest version to fix it.

- Storybook's CLI provides support for both [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package managers. If you have Yarn installed in your environment but prefer to use npm as your default package manager add the `--use-npm` flag to your installation command. For example:

  ```shell
  npx storybook init --use-npm
  ```
  
- For other installation issues, check the [Ember README](../../app/ember/README.md) for additional instructions.
