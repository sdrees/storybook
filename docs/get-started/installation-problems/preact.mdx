- Storybook's CLI provides support for both [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package managers.
  If you have Yarn installed in your environment but prefer to use npm as your default package manager add the `--use-npm` flag to your installation command. For example:

  ```shell
  npx storybook init --use-npm
  ```

- Add the `--type preact` flag to the installation command to set up Storybook manually:

  ```shell
  npx sb init --type preact
  ```

- For other installation issues, check the [Preact README](../../app/preact/README.md) for additional instructions.
