- Add the `--type react` flag to the installation command to set up Storybook manually:

  ```shell
  npx storybook init --type react
  ```

  - Storybook's CLI provides support for both [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package managers. If you have Yarn installed in your environment but prefer to use npm as your default package manager add the `--use-npm` flag to your installation command. For example:

  ```shell
  npx storybook init --use-npm
  ```

- Storybook supports Webpack 5 out of the box. If you're upgrading from a previous version, run the following command to enable it:

  ```shell
  npx storybook@next automigrate
  ```

  Check the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#cra5-upgrade) for more information on how to set up Webpack 5.

- For other installation issues, check the [React README](../../app/react/README.md) for additional instructions.
