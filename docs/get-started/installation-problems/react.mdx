- Add the `--type react` flag to the installation command to set up Storybook manually:

  ```shell
  npx sb init --type react
  ```

- Storybook supports Webpack 5 out of the box. If you're upgrading from a previous version, run the following command to enable it:

  ```shell
  npx sb@next automigrate
  ```

  Check the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#cra5-upgrade) for more information on how to set up Webpack 5.

- For other installation issues, check the [React README](../../app/react/README.md) for additional instructions.
